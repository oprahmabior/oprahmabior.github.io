        <h1>ITS A YEAR OF ME AND YOU AND MORE YRS.<p>
            i want to thank you for everything that you have done for me my love , you've kissed my wounds,taught me to be a better person, loved sides of me which i know are really hard to love .i myself found them hard to love but you closed your eyes and chose to love me regardless of each and everything 
            <p>
                I remember  the moment i fell in love with you like it was yesterday , i remember you thanking an askari after he opened a gate to let us in ,i really couldnt understand how kind of a person you're or comprehend the fact that you're that kind i found my heart accepting you without any hesitation or what my love. All my life i had no one but you came and changed that for me 365 days ago 
                you came and showed me that you cared not like everyone else, ohh how to thank God  for you!? I cry most times about how lucky i am and how the heavens blessed me  or what could have made God think i'm deserving of you . i look at you and see you holding our baby , kissing me in the morning before work,us travelling together,see you succeding in your life , see us on a friday in your house giving you a gentle massage till you softly sleep on my hands and feel safe around me 
                I just want to say this has been the best 365 days of all my life with you in it . YOU'RE THE REASON I BELIEVE GOD LOVES ME
